The challenge lies in developing an AI-powered SaaS-cum-E-Commerce integration
platform that connects handicraft manufacturers, consultants, and homeowners to
revolutionize the home decor ecosystem. The platform must address the following
requirements:
1. Handicraft Manufacturers:
Enable manufacturers to upload production data, including inventory
availability and production timelines.
Leverage this data to predict future demand using AI/ML, improving output
efficiency and reducing waste.
Create opportunities for niche manufacturers to showcase their products to a
wider audience.
2. Consultants (Architects, Designers, Civil Engineers, Decorators, etc.):
Empower consultants to launch personalized e-commerce brands within 30
minutes, without the need for inventory ownership, operational staff, or
technical expertise.
Provide a freemium model to allow consultants to list a limited number of
products initially, encouraging widespread adoption.
Automate backend operations, including product photography, logistics,
payment processing, and returns management.
Use AI to analyze consultant preferences and build customized product
catalogs that reflect their unique taste.
3. Homeowners:
Offer homeowners access to curated, consultant-approved designs and
products, reducing the hassle of searching for quality home decor.
Minimize product returns by connecting homeowners with consultants who
understand their style and preferences.
4. Platform Requirements:
Provide dashboards tailored to the needs of manufacturers, consultants,
homeowners, and the platform administrators.
Use fintech solutions to manage seamless payments and transactions for all
stakeholders.
Collect and analyze large volumes of data from consultants’ personalized
stores to predict trends, inform manufacturing, and optimize the supply chain.
Impact:
This platform will democratize access to e-commerce for consultants, streamline operations
for handicraft manufacturers, and provide homeowners with personalized home decor
solutions. It will foster collaboration across stakeholders, reduce inefficiencies, and ensure
equitable growth in the home decor and design industry.
